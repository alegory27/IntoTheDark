       <p><center> Compelled more by curiousity than fear, you decide that perhaps the noise is your best chance at getting out of this mess. One way or another... </center></p>
       <p><center> You slowly start shuffling your feet towards the groans. You can tell you are getting closer. The groaning is becoming louder faster than before.</center></p>
       <p><center> You're approaching the source of the noise. You can hear it right in front of you. As you call out, it stops. </center></p>

       <code><center>
           Hello? Who's there? Show yourself! 
       </center></code>

       <p><center> A deep rumbling emerges from the ground beneath you. The awful groaning bellows all around you!</center></p>
       <p><center> You feel something hard and cold wrap around your ankles. Slithering upwards, tightening its grasp. </center></p>

       <code><center>
           IT'S THE PLANTS!! IT'S THE TREES!! THEY'RE ALIVE!!! AAAAAAAAARGGHHHH
       </center></code>

       <p><center> The pain become too excrutiating and you pass out.</center></p>
