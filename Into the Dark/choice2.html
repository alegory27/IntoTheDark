       <p><center> You fumble around as you try to make sense of your surroundings. Your vision severly diminished. The ground is uneven and cold.</center></p>
       <p><center> You managed to walk a few feet before tripping over what seems to be a root. You look upwards from the ground and can see the tiniest specks of light shimmering through the abyss that surrounds you.</center></p>
       <p><center> You squint at the sight and try your hardest to focus your eyes. The lights begin to shimmer more rapidly as a soft breeze caresses your face. It dawns on you. </center></p>
       <code><center>
           It's a forest... I'm in a forest... a very dark one... 
       </center></code>
       <p><center> You move around the tree you just fell over. Inspecting every inch. You find a small box hidden away at the base.</center></p>
