       <p><center> Confusion and panic begin to creep into your mind. The silence is unnerving. It almost seems sentient. Wanting to take hold of it's new prey.</center></p>
       <p><center> You're determined to remove it's influence from your mind. After all, it does one no good to panic when lost. Especially one so far from home.</center></p>
       <p><center> You position yourself upright. Trying to get as comfortable as you can on the hard ground. You close your eyes and turn your focus inward. Concentrating on your breath.</center></p>
       <p><center> Time starts to lose meaning as you feel the tension slowly withdraw from your awareness. You open your eyes and know what you must do.</center></p>
       
       <code><center>
           I need to start moving. I need to start looking for a way out of here.
       </center></code>
       
       <p><center> You stand up and prepare yourself for your journey.</center></p>
