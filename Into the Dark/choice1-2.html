       <p><center> Fear consumes your being. Calling out to you as loudly as the mysterious groans.</center></p>
       <p><center> As you start to panic, the darkness around grows. You finally start moving your legs and carry yourself away into who knows what. Your racing thoughts only adding more to your confusion.</center></p>
