       <p><center> It's cold... The air is still... You slowly open your eyes. It's dark. Did you even open them?</center></p>
       <p><center> You stand up and gather your senses. Your eyes slowly adjust to the abyss. You can just barely make out your hands as you bring them close to your face.</center></p>
       <p><center> At first lost for words, you begin to call out. </center></p>
       <code><center>
           Hello? Is anyone there? Where am I? What is this place?

       <p><center> Silence. Nothing. Not even an echo.</center>
